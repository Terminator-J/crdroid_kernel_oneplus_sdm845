## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845 kernel tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

- Rebased on bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch as of April 2024 (final updates).
- Merged official LineageOS lineage-21 branch as of June 2024 (QPR3 merged) for U compatibility (and future support of retrofit dynamic partitions).
- Other goodies gathered from over the years including work from Anierin Bliss, mcdachpappe, EmanuelCN, and snnbyyds (among others I'm sure).
